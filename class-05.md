element (which means there is 
no closing tag).

**src**

**alt**

of the image that describes the image if you can not see it.

## Height & Width of Images

### height

image in pixels.

### width

# JPEG vs PNG vs GIF 

Several statistics reports indicate that these 3 formats together comprise of more than 95% of all images loaded on websites

## JPEG

 is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception. It can achieve compression ratios of 1:10 without any perceivable difference in quality.

 ## PNG

  is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image.

  ## GIF 
  
  is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm.
