To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of 
related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key. 

### WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?

Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the 
browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These 
built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. 


### GLOBAL OBJECTS: STRING O BJECT

Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties 
and methods of the String object on that value. This example stores the 
phrase "Home sweet home " in a variable.

In JavaScript there are six data types: 
Five of them are described as simple (or primitive) data types. 
The sixth is the object (and is referred to as a complex data type).
