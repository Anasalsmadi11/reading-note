<h2 style='color:red'> Layout</h2>

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its 
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

<h2 style='color:red'> Containing Elements</h2>

If one block-level element sits inside another 
block-level element then the outer box is 
known as the containing or parent element

<h2 style='color:red'> Floating Elements</h2>

<h3 style='color:green'> float</h3>
The float property allows you 
to take an element in normal 
flow and place it as far to the 
left or right of the containing 
element as possible.
The **blockquote** element 
is floated to the right, and the 
paragraphs that follow the quote 
flow around the floated element.

<h3 style='color:green'> Screen Sizes</h2>

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show 
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to 
work on a range of different sized screens.

<h2 style='color:red'> Screen Resolution</h2>

Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some 
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most 
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

<h3 style='color:green'> Page Sizes</h3>

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web 
designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide 
(since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens)

<h3 style='color:green'> A Fixed Width Layout</h3>

To create a fixed width layout, 
the width of the main boxes on 
a page will usually be specified 
in pixels (and sometimes their 
height, too).

<h3 style='color:green'> Layout Grids</h3>


Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) 
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are 
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them 
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.
