# TML&CSS
*As a web deeloper you may assk your self how can you comunicate with client and providr something useful for him and the audiance*

*Every website should be designed for the 
target audience—not just for yourself or the 
site owner. It is therefore very important to 
understand who your target audience is*

## Target Audience: individuals

<ul>

<li>What is the age range of your target audience?</li>
<li>Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?</li>
<li> Which country do your visitors live in and so on</li>

</ul>

## Target Audience: Companies

<ul>
<li>What is the size of the company or relevant department?</li>
<li>What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?</li>
<li>Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?</li>

</ul>

## Why People Visit YOUR Website

*once you know who your visitors are, you 
need to **consider** why they are coming. While 
some people will simply chance across your 
website, most will visit for a specific reason*

*Your content and design should 
be influenced by the goals of 
your users.*

*To help determine why people 
are coming to your website, 
there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:

1. The first attempts to discoverthe underlying motivations for 
why visitors come to the site.

2. The second examines the 
specific goals of the visitors. 
These are the triggers making 
them come to the site now*

## What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
*It is unlikely that you will be able to list every 
reason why someone visits your site but you 
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This 
information can help guide your site designs.* 

## What Information Your Visitors Need

*You know who is coming to your site and why 
they are coming, so now you need to work out 
what information they need in order to achieve 
their goals quickly and effectively.*

**Now that you know what needs to appear 
on your site, you can start to organize the 
information into sections or pages.**

*The aim is to create a diagram 
of the pages that will be used 
to structure the site. This is 
known as a site map and it will 
show how those pages can be 
grouped.*

## grouping and Similarity
<ul>
<li>Proximity</li>
<li>Closure</li>
<li>Continuance</li>
</ul>

## HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.

*They are covered here (rather than with the other HTML 
elements you met earlier in the book) because you'll find 
it easier to understand how they can be used now that you 
have seen how CSS can control the layout a page*
<ul>

<li>The new HTML5 layout elements and their uses</li>

<li>How they offer helpful alternatives to the <div> element</li>

<li>● How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements</li>

</ul>

## Navigation
*The <nav> element is used to 
contain the major navigational 
blocks on the site such as the 
primary site navigation.*

## Articles
*The <article> element acts as 
a container for any section of a 
page that could stand alone and 
potentially be syndicated.*

## Article
*The <aside> element has two 
purposes, depending on whether 
it is inside an <article>
element or not.*
